                                    <p class="tm-text-gray">Boac Cathedral was one of the oldest built heritage of Marinduque province. It was constructed
                                         around 1590s, and was designed with earthquake baroque architecture. It is located on top of a hill surrounded by 
                                          stone walls and bulwarks. During the old times it was once a haven and a fortress of the natives. Inside the 
                                           compound is the original site of the ‚ÄúIna ng Biglang-awa‚Äù shrine. In 1579, a Franciscan missionary, Fray Estevan Ortiz,
                                            planted the first cross on Marinduque island. After a year, the first visita that was called ‚ÄúMonserrat de 
                                             and now is the municipality of  Boac, was established with Fray Alonzo Banol as its minister.</p>

                                    <p class="tm-text-gray">If you like gazing at corals and colorful schools of fish rather than swimming and grilling, then you shouldn‚Äôt miss Amoingon Beach in Marinduque. Its waters are so teeming with marine life that many would call it the snorkeling capital of Marinduque. Still, if you‚Äôre not a fan of marine life or anything like that, you can still have fun above the clear shallow waters of Amoingon Beach. Get some fresh air and sunshine outdoors, 
                                        or rent the nearest transient house and inhale the smell of the sea every morning while jogging.
                                   Amoingon Beach is located in Boac, mainland Marinduque and is accessible from either Santa Cruz of Mogpog via buses or longer jeepney rides
